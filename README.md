Welcome to JSON Filter v0.4 !	{#welcome}
=====================

We all have been through a stage when we have a JSON and have to either filter it or search for a value. The only solution is writing multiple loops and if / else statements.
This library was written for personal usage only, but you are free use or help me improve it.


----------


Features
---------

**JSON Filter** currently filters the JSON based on a ***key*** and can match the ***value*** if provided. The best feature is it can search for a ***key*** at any level / depth. Works fine with nested JSON objects also. If no ***key*** is provided, the complete JSON is returned.

-------


Dependencies
-------------

 1. [jQuery][1]

------


Future Plans
-------------

Complatibility to work even if ***key*** is not provided but a ***value*** is provided. In short making it either ***key*** driven or ***value*** driven.
